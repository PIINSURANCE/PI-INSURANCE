PI INSURANCE  - WHITE PAPER
1.	Locating the problem
With the advancement of technology and cryptocurrencies, the world of the metaverse is increasingly developed. In this ecosystem, countless portals appear, where users acquire properties for large amounts of money. One of the biggest problems of cryptocurrencies has always been linked to the possibility of receiving fraud and losing large amounts of money. 
In the physical world, properties are linked to a series of insurances that provide protection and peace of mind against any unforeseen event that may happen; fires, water damage, weather phenomena, accidents etc. 
In the virtual world, we still do not find platforms that guarantee this long-term peace of mind and we believe that it is essential to be able to give this protection to the users of the metaverse. Large insurers are beginning to analyze these risks and consider their participation in the coming years. We believe that it is better that this ecosystem is protected by a totally virtual company that does not serve needs in the physical space and that only cares about the online space. 
Creator and project leader 
Marc Castell, current commercial director of an important insurer in the market, is preparing to enter the metaverse space, linking it to insurance. Providing the experience acquired in the physical world, adapting it to the digital world. After it, a whole team will be made, capable of managing the network. 
2.	Needs and phases of project development 
In the first place, it is essential, the participation in the project of a computer team, capable of carrying out all the development of the web infrastructure, which is capable of collecting all the subscribed policies, as well as a management space and payment of claims / incidents. 
STEP 1 
Development of an advanced web portal, capable of registering all insurance contracts, participants and properties to be protected. It is also necessary that the application has a section on management and payment of claims. Another section that must appear on the web is the creation of an "insurance pool" (defined in section 3), where users will make their contribution to the network, in the form of cryptocurrencies. With these shares, the pool will have sufficient capital to face future losses that occur. In our case, most of the claims will be highly linked to data and information theft, as well as cybercrime. Initially, contributions will be made through a pool, to ensure that our insurer has sufficient capital to correct future claims. 
Once the insurer has a high reserve fund, the disappearance of the pool and the contracting of individual policies will be assessed , with annual premiums adapted to the risk of your property in the metaverse. 
STEP 2
Preparation of a risk analysis, to determine which properties can be accepted in the insurance pool and which cannot. Some of the parameters that will be used are; The reliability of the metaverse portal, the years of experience and action in the market, the volatility of the property in the metaverse, the user who is available as the owner of the same etc. 
All this risk analysis will be the one that will finally determine if this user can access the pool and what their minimum contribution should be. 
STEP 3
Once the website has been prepared and the risk analysis has been executed, the platform will be launched on the network, where users can start their requests for contributions to the insurance pool and where these contributions will begin to be accepted, with the aim of expanding the economic capacity of the same pool and being able to guarantee any loss to its users. 
A 'period of time will be established for users to make their contributions and these will accumulate. 
Not all risks will be focused within the same pool, but different groups will be generated grouped by risks of a similar typology. 
STEP 4
Adaptation of the web portal to a mobile app,  where the user has access to all the pools in which he participates,  what  his contribution is and what amount is the maximum he can receive as compensation for a claim. A review of all the pools subscribed so far will be carried out, as well as their monetary return, making a loss rate that allows us to observe if the contributions are adequate, or if they should be higher or even lower, in the case of determining low accident rate and excessive contributions. The accident rate will include payments in claims, as well as payments derived to the team of our website for its service, which, in any case, will affect a small amount. The team will consist of the president, the web developers, the risk assessment team and the claims management team. The accounting part will initially be carried out by the president. The accounts will be published annually, to ensure optimal  operation of the insurer and avoid unjustified enrichment.
STEP 5
After checking the operation of the system and the pools, once the insurer has a sufficiently high capital, the creation of the pools will be eliminated and a new phase will begin with the elaboration of totally individual policies for each risk. In this way, the risks will be better defined, the payment of the premium according to the accident rate assessed for risks of similar typology and the total payment of compensation, leaving aside the proportional payment that was made for contributions in the insurance pool.
3.	Operation of the insurance pool 
The insurance pool, as we have defined above, is a common contribution of certain users, with the aim of guaranteeing the payment of compensation in case of accidents produced with the properties they acquire in the metaverse. 
These pools will be divided grouped into different categories, for example: 
-	Building pool
-	Pool of works of art
-	Pool of cities
All the necessary ones will be added according to the demands of the users, which will be collected and analyzed by the risk department. 
Each pool will have a time limit for all the contributions of interested users to be made. 
The payment of compensation will be made in proportion to the capital contributed and always complying with a series of budgets that guarantee the optimal functioning of the network. The contributions will be made on an annual basis and the management of the pool capital will be carried out as follows: 
-	80% for the payment of compensation for claims. 
-	10% for network maintenance and portal improvement 
-	10% for the administrative team 
Let's take an example of how the pool works: 
Pool of buildings in which a capital of € 3,000,000 is accumulated. Capital can be entered with ETH or BTC. 
-	Capital allocated to the payment of compensation € 2,400,000 
-	Capital allocated to improve the network and the portal € 300,000
-	Capital allocated to the administrative team € 300,000 
Once the pool is 1 year old and with the valuation of all the claims it is determined that a series of valid claims have been presented that in their entirety amount to a capital of € 4,000,000 in compensation. The pool can support a capital of € 2,400,000, which is the proportional part of the capital contributed and will compensate with these amounts. 
Let's say, that the number of claims are 4, distributed among 4 different users and the contributions are also different. Let's see: 
-	User 1: I contribute €50,000 to the pool 
-	User 2: I contribute €100,000 to the pool
-	User 3: I contribute €10,000 to the pool 
-	User 4: I contribute € 120,000 to the pool 
The total capital contributed in total by these users is € 280,000 and the compensation of € 2,400,000 will be made proportionally to the capital contributed. 
-	User 1: 17.86% - Receive 428.640€
-	User 2: 35.71% - Receive €857,040
-	User 3: 3.57% - Receive €85,680
-	User 4: 42.86% - Receive €1,028,640
In the event that the pool year ends with a loss rate lower than the capital set aside for the payment of compensation, the remaining part will be distributed proportionally to the contributions in all pool users. 
Each risk that enters the pool will be studied individually with its appropriate risk assessment. For example, contributions of € 10,000 will not be accepted, to guarantee  the payment of risks that are worth € 100 in full, thus guaranteeing the non-violation of our network and free enrichment. Therefore, each contribution must be linked to the risk you want to protect, with its consequent identification of this, with the evidence that the team requires. In addition, each declared claim will be thoroughly evaluated, with the aim of identifying any attempt at fraud. Our team will maintain constant contact with the different portals of the metaverse, to receive true information of what has happened and all the existing evidence. 
With this detailed study, we will achieve that only those users who have really been victims of  an incident can recover part of their capital invested in the metaverse and in some cases the totality of it.
4.	Reviews 
This White paper is subject to subsequent modifications, always with the aim of improving its content and with the possibility of improving the network and its operation. In addition, all kinds of external references will be attended, which can help the project to make it a total reality.
